        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Some sweet strawberry, exceedingly rare, however, I have a feeling it may not be so for you. Perfect with <em>Thaylen bread</em>, just make sure it isn&rsquo;t poisoned. Also, don&rsquo;t take it near an <strong>Elsecaller</strong>, I heard it isn&rsquo;t very popular with them.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 cups strawberries</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp butter</li>
            <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 package low-sugar-required pectin</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove stems and leaves from strawberries. Crush them to a chunky pulp - it should result in about 6 cups.</li>
            <li>Put crushed strawberries in a medium-sized pot. Add butter and sugar. Sprinkle pectin over the sugar.</li>
            <li>Mix everything together, bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, then simmer 20-30 minutes until gelled.</li>
            <li>To tell when the mixture has hit the gel point, either use a cooking thermometer (gel point is 220 degrees Fahrenheit at sea level, and decreases with elevation) or dip a spoon in the boiling mixture, pop the spoon in the freezer for a minute to cool, then see if the jam on the spoon has hit a consistency that you like yet. You'll want to look for a skin forming over the spoon, and the jam not just being thickened, but gelled up and holding together.</li>
            <li>If you can the jam, leave 1/4 inch headspace and process for 10 minutes (longer at higher elevations).</li>
            <li>To freeze the jam, place the jam in plastic containers, and freeze.</li>
        </ol>
